# ElevenAudioBooks
So, I recently upgraded my iMac to Big Sur and stumbled across the new audiobooks "app". The app is lacking tons of features compared to iTunes, especially lacking metadata editing.
As I'm somewhat of a hobbyist software developer, I wrote a buggy macOS app which is able to natively edit at least some of the audio book metadata "in place".

This app achieves what I intended it to do (basically edit some mistyped title names). I consider it "stable" as in "hot pile of crap", and "feature complete" as in "not feature complete".
There's so much more to do, like sorting all audioboks, implementing a player, editing artwork, reworking the title editor... you get it.

**WARNING:** This messes around with a load of Books.app databases and thus is NOT recommended as a stable solution to anyone.

Nonetheless, *if* you're a user desperately searching for a utility to edit your audiobooks library while *loving* the thrill of possibly crashing your Mac, feel free to try it out.

If you're a developer interested in building on my base, feel free to fork, commit, whatever.
